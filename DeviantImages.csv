I did not once get a feeling of any sort of bond between them. I would sooner have believed that they were close friends who had drifted apart rather than sisters, because the movie shows that throughout the years, ', 'despite ', 'the fact that they are sisters and live in the same place, they don\'t spend any time with each other. It\'s made out that Elsa just stays in her room all day while Anna entertains herself alone, and that the coronation is the first time Elsa ever actually leaves her room, apart from when they said goodbye to their parents. And then even after Elsa\'s powers are revealed 90% of the movie she is never even in the same scene as Anna. What I\'m saying is, the movie did a very poor job of actually making the sisterly bond between them the focus, or even convincing. Aside from when they were kids, the only real ""sisterly"" moment I can remember about them is that small talk they have during the coronation party where they both go ""mmm, chocolate"". That\'s it. Sure Anna goes after Elsa when she leaves but I mean she kind of ', 'had ', 'to', '\xa0', ""since Elsa just up and left the entire kingdom cursed with eternal winter.\xa0The rest of the movie? It's a boring road trip following Anna, who personality-wise hasn't got a lot going for her other than her I guess dorky positive attitude (she talks like a modern teenager which puts me off), and Kristoff, who serves "", 'no purpose ', 'in the movie and also doesn\'t have much of a personality. He is only there as a plot device, so that Anna can travel through the snow (which really she could\'ve done herself if she had actually prepared instead of just rushing off in her party dress on a horse like an idiot), and I guess he\'s also there to fool the audience into thinking he would be the ""true love"" that will melt Anna\'s heart when she\'s frozen. Even in the latest Frozen short, Kristoff is barely a character, he\'s just ', 'there', '. If Disney really wanted to dispense with the whole ""every princess needs a true love/prince"" cliche then they could\'ve gone to the lengths of actually making Kristoff a respectful character who is ', 'equal ', ""to Anna that doesn't end up with her, or just not have him be in there at all."", ""Honestly I could go on about a whole bunch of other things that makes Frozen bad, like the plot making little to no sense, the villain being lame and contrived, and Elsa herself being such a shallow underdeveloped character - but if I'm just going to address the point about sisterly love then I think I've said enough. If you want a Disney movie with a beautiful and believable sisterly bond then Lilo and Nani from "", 'Lilo and Stitch ', 'are a thousand times better than Elsa and Anna. Heck even Hiro and Tadashi from Big Hero 6, even with the small amount of screentime those two got together, did a better job of showing a beautiful and strong sibling relationship than Frozen did.
