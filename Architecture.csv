Lors de fouilles archéologiques dans l’Aile de la Salle du Jardin, on a découvert l’existence de murs médiévaux et d’un sol de mortiers', 'datant de la fin du 13', ' siècle. Cependant ces quelques vestiges ne permettent pas de se faire une idée de l’apparence et de la disposition du château à cette époque.', 'A l’occasion', 'de travaux d’assainissement de la tour du donjon ', 'réalisés de 1989 à 1993 le service archéologique du canton de Berne a pratiqué des sondages sur la tour, ce qui a permis d’approfondir nos connaissances et de dater sa construction au haut moyen âge dans les environs de 1200 à cette époque il s’élevait à environ 18 mètres. Et au début du 13', ' siècle le donjon fût une première fois surélevé pour atteindre ', 'une hauteur de 24 mètres.', 'Dans un second temps on construisit un nouvel étage en pierre du tuf, la tour était alors couronnée de créneaux disposés de manière irrégulière.

Le donjon n’avait alors qu’une fonction défensive.', 'En 1652, Oberhofen devint un baillage et durant la période de 1652 à 1798 le château subit de nombreuses transformations. En 1662, le donjon fût recouvert de crépi ', 'et on y ajouta deux grandes armoiries Bernoises, pour finir le donjon fût pourvut d’un toit surmonté de deux pommeaux avec girouettes. ', 'La tourelle du lac est une construction remontant à la fin du moyen âge, probablement de la seconde partie du 15', ' siècle. Malheureusement cette tourelle fût détruite en 1759, car faute d’entretien, cette partie était dans un fort état de délabrement, elle fût reconstruite en 1895-1896, sur ordre de la comtesse Hélène Von Harrach. Comme l’édifice original, la nouvelle tourelle est reconstruite en colombage.', 'Dans les années 1849 à 1853 de grands travaux de transformations furent entrepris à la demande des comtes de Pourtalès. D’après les plans de James Colin (architecte neuchâtelois), Le donjon fût réaménagé à l’intérieur, et on ajouta à la façade de nouveaux éléments néogothiques en grès, tel des balcons, gargouilles et des fenêtres richement agrémentées. La tour bénéficia de nouvelles décorations sculptées d’une qualité exceptionnelle réalisées par le sculpteur hollandais Joseph Hubert Verbunt. Outre le donjon, les travaux de restaurations du château effectués aux alentours de', ""1850, comprenaient l’ornementation des toits avec des structures de tôles et des tuiles multicolores sur certaines dépendances, la reconstruction du pavillon Elsi (la tour d'angle nord), Le réaménagement du parc avec la construction de la maison du jardiner construite en colombage et le chalet des enfants construit en 1853. "", 'En 1925-26 le château fût vendu par Hans Albrecht à l’avocat américain William Maul Measey qui tomba amoureux du château lors d’un voyage dans l’Oberland Bernois, Il veilla avec soin et amour au château et à son parc avec une attention toute particulière au jardin.', 'C’est à William Maul Measey que l’on doit la création de la Fondation «\xa0château d’Oberhofen\xa0» Car n’aillant aucun enfant, l’avocat américain de Philadelphie désirait ouvrir son château au publique.', 'La fondation a confié en 1952 au Musée d’histoire de Berne l’entretien du château et de son parc qui fût ensuite aménagé de 1953-1963 en musée', 'conformément au souhait de William Maul Measey.

In “Celebration” the composition loses overall impact because the details overwhelm the viewer. The red lantern across the street forms a key point of interest, but because this lantern is also quite detailed I don’t think the composition works as well as it could. I think the remedy would be to find a way to include more foreground detail which is the formula you have used in many of your other works.', 'Your piece titled “Wonder ', 'www.deviantart.com/anthonypres…', ', and the other works I mentioned (Night Explore and Tokyo in Science Fiction) really encapsulate what I am trying to say with regards to light and composition.', 'To sum up my critique, I’d like to say the style and technique you have developed is brilliant, and speaking as an artist myself, I guess at some point you may reach a conclusion with this style and move on to something new, but for now we will enjoy seeing each new Deviation you post in this series, they are a breath of fresh oriental air!', 'Amazing!', 'Nice', 'Woah!', 'I cant believe this is not a painting.

While I believe the expression should be spread evenly around the page, I found your way of giving expression in contrasting corners quite intriguing. The rainbow of colour you've used suggest that the night is bright, electric and vivid in Paris; I see you wanted to stray away from the traditional idea of what a night should be, and you've done a brilliant job.
